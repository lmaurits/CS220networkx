# CS220networkx
Jupyter notebook for CS220 lecture 12, 2016 S2

This lecture takes the form of a "Jupyter notebook" (formerly known as iPython
notebook).  This a way to nicely combine written text, Python code and the
output of that code in an interactive way.  It's a great teaching tool.

You can use this Notebook in two ways.  If you click on the `index.ipynb` file
in the list above, you can look at a non-interactive, statically rendered
version of the Notebook, provided by GitHub.

Or you can click on this "Launch Binder" button:
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/lmaurits/cs220networkx)
This will present you with an interactive version of the lecture, i.e. you can
change the code and recompute the output to see the results.  This is a free
service provided by Binder.  The catch is that the interactive versions you
launch only live for an hour or so.  After that, the URL becomes invalid and you
lose all your changes.

If you want to make persistent changes for some reason, you can install Jupyter
on your own machine and clone this repository.
